In the event any child of mine is under the age of twenty-five (25) years at the time of distribution, then I bequeath and devise said property to my Trustee, {TRUSTEE_NAME}, hereinafter named, to be held, managed and controlled as a Trust Estate, with all the rights and powers, and subject to the limitations hereinafter enumerated for the following uses and purposes:

(1) My Trustee shall pay to my children, or expend upon their behalf such part or all of the net income from the Trust as my Trustee may deem advisable for their support, maintenance, welfare, and education. My Trustee shall also have the power in the Trustee's sole discretion to encroach upon the corpus of the Trust Estate in such amounts and at such times as the Trustee may deem necessary in order to provide for the support, maintenance, welfare and education of my children. Realizing that one child may require the expenditure of more money than another, the payment or expenditure of net income and/or corpus to or for said beneficiaries need not be equal but may be in such proportions as my Trustee in my Trustee's sole discretion may determine is appropriate, such determination being final and conclusive upon all beneficiaries.

(2) Neither the corpus nor the income of this Trust shall be pledged, assigned, transferred, sold, or in any manner whatsoever, accelerated, anticipated, or encumbered by a beneficiary, nor shall any income or corpus of said Trust Estate be in any manner subject or liable in the hands of the Trustee for the debt, contracts, or engagements of any beneficiary, or be subject to any assignment, or any other voluntary or involuntary alienation or disposition whatever. All distributions of income or corpus shall be paid only upon receipt to the beneficiary entitled, or to others for his or her use and benefit.

(3) This Trust shall terminate when my youngest child reaches the age of twenty-five (25) years of age. Upon termination, the Trustee shall distribute the balance of the assets then remaining in Trust to my children in equal shares, per stirpes, taking into account any advance distributions previously made.
